The phases of this playbook are:
  1) Check if assets (IP, Domain or Certificate) associated to the issue are excluded in the exclusions list.
  2) Optionally, enrich indicators and calculate the severity of the issue, using sub-playbooks.
  3) Optionally, allow the analyst to add associated assets (IP, Domain or Certificate) to the exclusions list.
  4) Tag associated assets.
  5) Update the status of the issue. (Available from Cortex XSOAR 6.0.0).
