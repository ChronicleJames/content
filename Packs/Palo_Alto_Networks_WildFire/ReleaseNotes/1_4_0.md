##### Palo Alto Networks WildFire v2
- Added new arguments ***polling*** to the commands ***wildfire-upload*** ***wildfire-upload-url*** ***wildfire-upload-file-remote*** and ***wildfire-upload-file-url***. 
When ***polling*** is used, the command will try to return the results.
  The new commands allow users to search WildFire with a single command, that doesn't require ***GenericPolling Playbook***.
